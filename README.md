# Launcher-Demo
This sample creates a launcher app similar to Google launcher.  
When we click on the home button this app opens and shows the list of all the apps in the mobile. We can search for an app with its name in the search view. It also opens that particular app when we click on it.  
The background of this app is also the same as the wallpaper of your phone.  
I have explained in details here.
